Original game contain 64 editable lines of code, wich make on some devices hard to read all of this small characters, 
so to fix it and also just for fun i made almost exact copy with JS and Canvas with main change - now user can edit only first 32 lines,
but memory still has all 256 bytes. So it easy to read and play i guess.
